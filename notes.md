# NOTEBOOK

## Notes

- Added resource_id to the comments schema

## Questions

- What happens if the data submitted to POST is incomplete?
- What should POST requests return?
- Do we need GET responses for POST endpoints?
- How exactly should GET requests return data (joined, split, array of IDs for comments etc.)
- Is there a need for `/me` in `/resources`, `/likes`, and `/comments`?

## TODO

- [ ] Detailed API map
